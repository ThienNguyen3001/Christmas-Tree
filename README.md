# Christmas-Tree
Because I don't have a girlfriend to walk with me at Christmas, I coded this thing. Also, because I'm free after many exams at school. :)
## How to download
* To edit the code, you use this command in Git: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/ThienNguyen3001/Christmas-Tree.git`
* If you just want to download it simply and don't care about the code, go to the `bin/Debug` folder and download the file named `Christmas Tree.exe`
# ðŸ‘‰ Please give me a star if you like it. Have fun!
